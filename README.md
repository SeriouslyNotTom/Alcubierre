<h1>What is Alcubierre?</h1>
Alcubierre is my attempt at a crossplatform game,rendering,application engine
not nearly close to being feature complete
currently only JATAPT is the software publically using this engine, and not to much of a degree

<h1>Building Alcubierre</h1>
<h2>Windows</h2>
All required dependencies for windows are already included in the repo as either dlls, libs or linked from source.
simply run:

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```
and......... your done... for now, until i add more complicated stuff
