</h3>if I (tom) or someone else has invited you then please read this entire guide and particularly the styling sections before making your first commit</h3>
<h2>Styling</h2>
I have chosen google's c++ styling for this project as well... google and it makes a lot of sense. you don't have to follow every point to a tee but please try your hardest to adhere to variable,function and parameter naming convertions and structure so that our code is readable and concise.

<h1>Building Alcubierre</h1>
<h2>Windows</h2>
All required dependencies for windows are already included in the repo as either dlls, libs or linked from source.
simply run:

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```
and......... your done... for now, until i add more complicated stuff
